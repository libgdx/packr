To build dropt:

For systems using gcc and GNU make:

    make -f Makefile.gcc [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]


For systems using Microsoft's C/C++ compiler (MSVC):

    nmake /f Makefile.vcwin32 [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]


Options:

    DEBUG=1
        Enables debug assertions and disables compiler optimizations.

    DROPT_NO_STRING_BUFFERS=1
        Disables dropt's string management functionality.  Enabling this
        will disable dropt's help facility and will disable built-in error
        messages.  Using this option isn't recommended, but it's provided
        for anyone who either:

        A. Requires strict C89 compatibility.
        B. Is paranoid and doesn't trust dropt's string routines.

    _UNICODE=1
        Uses wchar_t strings. (Windows-only)

    DYNAMIC_CRT=1
        Links against Microsoft's C run-time library dynamically instead of
        statically. (Windows-only)


Targets:

    all         Builds everything.
    clean       Deletes built files.
    example     Builds the example.
    lib         Builds the dropt C static library.
    libxx       Builds the dropt C++ static library.
    test        Builds and runs the dropt unit tests.

    The default target builds lib and libxx.
